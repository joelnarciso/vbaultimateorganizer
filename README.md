Ultimate Organizer (VBA) Project

A project for 'Excel/VBA for Creative Problem Solving, Part 3' course at Coursera.

This project has wide-ranging uses and applications.  Create a VBA user form that will:
  1) allow the user to add or delete new categories (user-defined) to a data table (these would be the columns/column headings) on a main worksheet,
  2) allow the user to add or delete records (a row of a table), and 
  3) allow the user to look up different categories for a record (basically searching through the data and outputting a specific user-defined category) with the option of replacing those items.
